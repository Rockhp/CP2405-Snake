"""Define collection of file I/O functions used throughout program.

This module holds a series of file I/O functions responsible for reading and
writing to critical txt files that store important information and data used
throughout the program. Specific file names used: game_options.txt,
high_scores.txt, and user_preferences.txt (for now).

Functions:
    get_file_dict: Converts entered txt file into dict and returns it.
    get_score_name_list: Gets list of all (score, name) pairs.
    get_page_of_user_row: Gets list of all (rank, score, name) pairs on the
        same page as the entered one, as well as the entered pair's index.
    save_new_player_score: Saves entered (score, name) pair to high_scores txt.
    set_new_user_preferences: Saves changes to game options in user pref txt.
    update_settings_real_time: Allows settings to be updated real time while
        in game options screen.
